#Abstract Factory

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

---

### Use the Abstract Factory pattern when

- A system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
- A system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
- A family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint.
- You want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations.

### Participants

- __AbstractFactory__

Declares an interface for operations that create abstract product objects.

- __ConcreteFactory__

Implements the operations to create concrete product objects.


- __AbstractProduct__

Declares an interface for a type of product object.

- __ConcreteProduct__

Defines a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory.
Implements the AbstractProduct interface.

- __Client__

Uses only interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct classes.

### Collaborations

- Normally a single instance of a ConcreteFactory class is created at run-time. This concrete factory creates product objects having a particular implementation. To create different product objects, clients should use a different concrete factory.
- AbstractFactory defers creation of product objects to its ConcreteFactory sub class.

### Consequences

The Abstract Factory pattern has the following benefits and liabilities:

1. It isolates concrete classes. The Abstract Factory pattern helps you control the classes of objects that an application creates. Because a factory encapsulates the responsibility and the process of creating product objects, it isolates clients from implementation classes. Clients manipulate instances through their abstract interfaces. Product class names are isolated in the implementation of the concrete factory; they do not appear in client code.

2. It makes exchanging product families easy. The class of a concrete factory appears only once in an applicationâ€”that is, where it's instantiated. This makes it easy to change the concrete factory an application uses. It can use different product configurations simply by changing the concrete factory. Because an abstract factory creates a complete family of products, the whole product family changes at once. In our user interface example, we can switch from Motif widgets to Presentation Manager widgets simply by switching the corresponding factory objects and recreating the interface.

### Implementation

1. Factories as singletons. An application typically needs only one instance of a ConcreteFactory per product family. So it's usually best implemented as a Singleton.

2. Creating the products. AbstractFactory only declares an interface for creating products. It's up to ConcreteProduct subclasses to actually create them. The most common way to do this is to define a factory method for each product. A concrete factory will specify its products by overriding the factory method for each. While this implementation is simple, it requires a new concrete factory subclass for each product family, even if the product families differ only slightly.
If many product families are possible, the concrete factory can be implemented using the Prototype pattern. The concrete factory is initialized with a prototypical instance of each product in the family, and it creates a new product by cloning its prototype. The Prototype-based approach eliminates the need for a new concrete factory class for each new product family.

3. Defining extensible factories. AbstractFactory usually defines a different operation for each kind of product it can produce. The kinds of products are encoded in the operation signatures. Adding a new kind of product requires changing the AbstractFactory interface and all the classes that depend on it.
A more flexible but less safe design is to add a parameter to operations that create objects. This parameter specifies the kind of object to be created. It could be a class identifier, an integer, a string, or anything else that identifies the kind of product. In fact with this approach, AbstractFactory only needs a single "Make" operation with a parameter indicating the kind of object to create. This is the technique used in the Prototype and the class-based abstract factories discussed earlier.
